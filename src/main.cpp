 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. The single-sided two-way ranging scheme implemented here has to be considered carefully as the accuracy of the distance measured is highly
 *    sensitive to the clock offset error between the devices and the length of the response delay between frames. To achieve the best possible
 *    accuracy, this response delay must be kept as low as possible. In order to do so, 6.8 Mbps data rate is used in this example and the response
 *    delay between frames is defined as low as possible. The user is referred to User Manual for more details about the single-sided two-way ranging
 *    process.
 *
 *    Initiator: |Poll TX| ..... |Resp RX|
 *    Responder: |Poll RX| ..... |Resp TX|
 *                   ^|P RMARKER|                    - time of Poll TX/RX
 *                                   ^|R RMARKER|    - time of Resp TX/RX
 *
 *                       <--TDLY->                   - POLL_TX_TO_RESP_RX_DLY_UUS (RDLY-RLEN)
 *                               <-RLEN->            - RESP_RX_TIMEOUT_UUS   (length of response frame)
 *                    <----RDLY------>               - POLL_RX_TO_RESP_TX_DLY_UUS (depends on how quickly responder can turn around and reply)
 *
 *
 * 2. The sum of the values is the TX to RX antenna delay, experimentally determined by a calibration process. Here we use a hard coded typical value
 *    but, in a real application, each device should have its own antenna delay properly calibrated to get the best possible precision when performing
 *    range measurements.
 * 3. The frames used here are Decawave specific ranging frames, complying with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard data frame encoding. The frames are the
 *    following:
 *     - a poll message sent by the initiator to trigger the ranging exchange.
 *     - a response message sent by the responder to complete the exchange and provide all information needed by the initiator to compute the
 *       time-of-flight (distance) estimate.
 *    The first 10 bytes of those frame are common and are composed of the following fields:
 *     - byte 0/1: frame control (0x8841 to indicate a data frame using 16-bit addressing).
 *     - byte 2: sequence number, incremented for each new frame.
 *     - byte 3/4: PAN ID (0xDECA).
 *     - byte 5/6: destination address, see NOTE 4 below.
 *     - byte 7/8: source address, see NOTE 4 below.
 *     - byte 9: function code (specific values to indicate which message it is in the ranging process).
 *    The remaining bytes are specific to each message as follows:
 *    Poll message:
 *     - no more data
 *    Response message:
 *     - byte 10 -> 13: poll message reception timestamp.
 *     - byte 14 -> 17: response message transmission timestamp.
 *    All messages end with a 2-byte checksum automatically set by DW IC.
 * 4. Source and destination addresses are hard coded constants in this example to keep it simple but for a real product every device should have a
 *    unique ID. Here, 16-bit addressing is used to keep the messages as short as possible but, in an actual application, this should be done only
 *    after an exchange of specific messages used to define those short addresses for each device participating to the ranging exchange.
 * 5. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW IC OTP memory.
 * 6. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
 *    refer to DW IC User Manual for more details on "interrupts". It is also to be noted that STATUS register is 5 bytes long but, as the event we
 *    use are all in the first bytes of the register, we can use the simple dwt_read32bitreg() API call to access it instead of reading the whole 5
 *    bytes.
 * 7. As we want to send final TX timestamp in the final message, we have to compute it in advance instead of relying on the reading of DW IC
 *    register. Timestamps and delayed transmission time are both expressed in device time units so we just have to add the desired response delay to
 *    response RX timestamp to get final transmission time. The delayed transmission time resolution is 512 device time units which means that the
 *    lower 9 bits of the obtained value must be zeroed. This also allows to encode the 40-bit value in a 32-bit words by shifting the all-zero lower
 *    8 bits.
 * 8. In this operation, the high order byte of each 40-bit timestamps is discarded. This is acceptable as those time-stamps are not separated by
 *    more than 2**32 device time units (which is around 67 ms) which means that the calculation of the round-trip delays (needed in the
 *    time-of-flight computation) can be handled by a 32-bit subtraction.
 * 9. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of the message as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
 *    automatically appended by the DW IC. This means that our variable could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
 *    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
 * 10. When running this example on the DW3000 platform with the POLL_RX_TO_RESP_TX_DLY response delay provided, the dwt_starttx() is always
 *     successful. However, in cases where the delay is too short (or something else interrupts the code flow), then the dwt_starttx() might be issued
 *     too late for the configured start time. The code below provides an example of how to handle this condition: In this case it abandons the
 *     ranging exchange and simply goes back to awaiting another poll message. If this error handling code was not here, a late dwt_starttx() would
 *     result in the code flow getting stuck waiting subsequent RX event that will will never come. The companion "initiator" example (ex_06a) should
 *     timeout from awaiting the "response" and proceed to send another poll in due course to initiate another ranging exchange.
 * 11. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *     DW IC API Guide for more details on the DW IC driver functions.
 * 12. In this example, the DW IC is put into IDLE state after calling dwt_initialise(). This means that a fast SPI rate of up to 20 MHz can be used
 *     thereafter.
 * 13. Desired configuration by user may be different to the current programmed configuration. dwt_configure is called to set desired
 *     configuration.
